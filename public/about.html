        <h2>Noise Pollution</h2>
        <p>
          Noise pollution is the intrusion of loud or unwarranted sounds that
          can detrimentally impact an individual's well-being. Assessing sound 
          involves parameters such as loudness,
          quantified as sound pressure level measured in decibels (dB). The human 
          auditory range spans from
          0 dB to 140 dB, with every 3 dB increase signifying a doubling in
          sound intensity. The chart below is a decibel chart, with
          examples of each sound level.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          Noise pollution is
          associated with adverse health effects such as cardiovascular
          problems, mental health impacts, hearing loss, and cognitive
          impairment <sup id = "about1" class = "ref">[<a href = "#about1ref">1</a>]</sup>. High noise levels increase the risk
          of individuals experiencing hearing impairment by 30% <sup id = "about2" class = "ref">[<a href = "#about2ref">2</a>]</sup>
          <sup id = "about3" class = "ref">[<a href = "#about3ref">3</a>]</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>  
          The issue
          of noise pollution is significant in Puerto Rico, where more than
          21% experience hearing loss in at least one ear (Cruickshanks et
          al., 2015). Among U.S. jurisdictions, Puerto Rico has the highest
          percentage of its population exposed to noise pollution (dB levels
          exceeding 70) at 44%, surpassing the average of 30% (Neitzel et al.,
          2023).
        </p>

        <p>
          Many national governments have legislation and decibel
          limit values that may apply either nationally or regionally, informed
          by noise exposure data and noise maps. Guidelines such as the WHO
          guidelines are public-health oriented and serve as the basis for
          policy-making. Noise mapping is a valuable tool
          for assessing and visualizing noise levels across a given region.
        </p>

        <h2>Noise Laws in Puerto Rico</h2>
        <p>
          Puerto Rico's regulations addressing noise pollution are described in
          the Public Order Code. Article 2,201 within the Public Order Code
          specifically outlines the legal framework associated with preventing
          noise pollution, emphasizing the importance of refraining from
          emitting or distributing noise that exceeds specified decibel level
          limits, contingent on the time of day. According to the law, the
          permissible sound levels are set at 65 decibels between 7 am and 10
          pm, and lowered to 55 decibels during nighttime hours.
